# ParetingBuddy API

Here is the code representing the beginning of our API. Please note that we switched to Firebase later in the development phase. Nevertheless, we were able to successfully implement several features up to this point:

## What has worked until then:

- Firebase Authentication: We successfully integrated sign-up through Firebase.
- S3 Bucket Image Upload + Image Compression: We were able to upload images to an S3 bucket while reducing their size simultaneously.
- Creating New Users
- Displaying and Saving Articles, Podcasts, and Timelines
